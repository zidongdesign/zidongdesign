However, during formal production, due to a large number of devices being in a discoverable state, it's challenging for workers to accurately identify and map QR code data. Consequently, we had to use the other two solutions. The option of placing CORE on the phone was discarded due to variations in the Bluetooth module positions of different devices, impacting pairing stability. In the end, we opted for the solution of selecting from a list. Many times, we aren't designing a perfect solution but rather balancing various factors to find equilibrium. Therefore, <strong>continually adjusting the weight of these factors in exploration helps us discover that clever balance.</strong></p>\n                <img :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/6/3-pairing-methods.png')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"\">\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"v-stack\">\n                <h3 v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">3. 体能测验和记录</h3>\n                <h3 v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">3.

However, we were surprised by user interviews that the user's \"willingness to train\" may not necessarily align with their \"physical capabilities.\" For various reasons, users might want to train areas other than their weaker ones, or their weaker areas might not be suitable for training. Therefore, we allow users to adjust the priority order of training areas to customize their workout plans. <strong>What users need based on rational judgment may not be what they want.</strong> This is a contradiction between rationality and sensibility.

I gained insights into the challenges of fundraising and felt the urgency of racing against time.

I realized that design goes beyond visuals; I needed to step into production, and even <strong>participate in trade shows to promote our products.</strong> It wasn't the glamorous entrepreneurial life I had envisioned</p>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">在RaceFit，我们没有产品经理这个角色，而每个人都是产品经理，我们在会议上讨论一切关于产品的未来的计划，作为设计负责人，我还担任起整理这些需求和梳理优先级的工作。从那时起，我才真正意识到，<strong>一个好的产品并非构思一个天才的灵感，</strong>每天都有大量相似的想法涌现，真正的挑战是我们如何将一个个的点子付诸行动，安排优先级，落到实处，并不断收集反馈和迭代...</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">At RaceFit, we don't have the role of a product manager; instead, everyone serves as a product manager.

It was from that point onward that I truly realized <strong>a great product isn't just about conceiving a brilliant idea</strong> – Similar thoughts emerge every day. The real challenge is how we turn individual ideas into actions, prioritize, implement, continually gather feedback, and iterate...</p>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">最后，我学到了一个深刻的教训，<strong>如果一个产品不能切切实实地解决用户的需求，美观、性能、价格等等因素都会被远远地排除在外。</strong>我们获得了很多设计上的成功，我们获得了红点产品奖，入选了Microsoft的初创加速计划，似乎市场对产品的反响不错。但当你问我如果一个用户购买了我们的产品，独自一人开始使用，他真实的流程是什么，他的感受是什么？我很遗憾地说我真的不知道，在我们的设计中缺少了这一个环节，<strong>我们没有聆听用户真正的声音，</strong>而被他们在接受访谈时的客套话蒙骗了</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In the end, I learned a profound lesson: <strong>if a product doesn't genuinely address the user's needs, factors like aesthetics, performance, and price are all significantly sidelined.</strong> We achieved a lot of design success, received the Red Dot Product Design Award, and were selected for Microsoft's startup accelerator program. It seemed like there was positive market feedback for the product. However, when asked about the real experience of a user purchasing our product, using it alone, and their feelings during the process, I regret to say that I genuinely don't know. There was a missing link in our design — <strong>we failed to listen to the authentic voices of users,</strong> being deceived by their courteous words during interviews</p>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">2022年9月我们停止了产品的更新，但我们仍然支付服务器的费用来让顾客继续使用购买了的产品。2023年10月，服务器被托管服务商单方面关停，紧接着我们收到了用户的抱怨，那一天，我感到愤怒和<strong>前所未有的欣慰</strong></p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In September 2022, we ceased product updates, but continued to cover server costs to allow customers to use the purchased product. In October 2023, the hosting service unilaterally shut down the servers. Shortly after, we received complaints from users.

Seizing this opportunity, Sikang and I conducted extensive\n            research and sharing on the theme of \"The Imprint of Chinese Culture in Design.\" Therefore,\n            <strong>\"understand your users\" is not just a slogan.</strong> Regardless of how culture changes or the\n            audience differs, the principle that never changed is our need to understand our users</p>\n            <img :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/7/china-design-pattern.png')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"\">\n        </div>\n        \n        <div class=\"v-stack\">\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">\n            <strong>没有什么比成为用户能够更快地了解用户。</strong>这是我在这个项目中的另一个体会。作为设计师，我们如果能够真正将亲手设计的产品用起来，甚至爱上他依赖他，那么我们不仅能够发现很多体验的问题，还能将产品故事讲好，充分认识产品的价值所在。于是我在UCL发布之后，通过\n            Updates 发布了一个收集 UCL 使用问题的 request，邀请大家填写反馈。</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\"><strong>Nothing helps you understand users faster than being\n                a user yourself. </strong> This is another learning I had in this project.

Based on this phenomenon, we boldly hypothesized that users could actually understand the threshold settings represented by Option B correctly. Due to Option B <strong>placing what content the system is going to block in a more prominent position,</strong> users can have a deeper understanding of the current system settings. As a result, they established an inherent cognitive bias that prevented them from correctly understanding Option A</p>\n            </div>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">通过这次测试，我们得到结论，为了保持 API 和界面的一致，并且遵循滑动条的模式，我们可以选择<strong>用设置阈值而不是设置敏感度来表示内容安全</strong></p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">Through this test, we concluded that, for the sake of maintaining consistency between the API and the interface, and following the slider pattern, we can choose to <strong>represent content safety by setting thresholds rather than adjusting sensitivity.</strong></p>\n\n        </PageSection>\n        <PageSection>\n            <h2 v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">迭代，验证，再迭代</h2>\n            <h2 v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">Iterate, validate, iterate again</h2>\n\n            <div class=\"v-stack\">\n                <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">在第一轮的用户测试中，我们还发现了一些 Option B 的可用性问题的端倪，于是我们进一步探索和迭代，得到了 Option C。为了进一步验证 Option C 的设计是有效的，我们开展了第二次用户测试，这次测试由用户研究员筹备和开展</p>\n                <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In the first round of user testing, we also identified some signals of usability issues with Option B.
