The sole activation method for the hardware is removing it from the charger, putting it in a constant state of Bluetooth discoverability. Consequently, when users open the app, the system attempts to search for nearby devices. If the number of devices doesn't meet the requirements, we prompt users to manually pair them. Who would have thought that this seemingly small feature would trouble us for so long...</p>\n            <img v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/6/pair-flow.svg')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"max-width: 480px;margin: 0 auto;\">\n            <img v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/6/pair-flow-EN.svg')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"max-width: 480px;margin: 0 auto;\">\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">我们尝试了三种配对方式，用户研究显示，扫描 QR code 的方式是最受用户信赖和最稳定的。然而，在正式生产时，由于大量硬件处于被发现状态，工人难以准确识别并映射二维码数据。因此，我们不得不转向另外两个方案，而由于将CORE放置在手机上的方案，因为不同设备的蓝牙模块位置不同，影响了配对稳定性，因此最终，我们选择了从列表中选择的方案。很多时候，我们并非设计一个完美的方案，而是权衡各个因素找出平衡，因此<strong>不断调整因素的权重进行探索，才能帮助我们找到那个巧妙的平衡</strong></p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">We tried three pairing methods, and user research indicates that scanning QR codes is the most trusted and stable option. However, during formal production, due to a large number of devices being in a discoverable state, it's challenging for workers to accurately identify and map QR code data. Consequently, we had to use the other two solutions. The option of placing CORE on the phone was discarded due to variations in the Bluetooth module positions of different devices, impacting pairing stability. In the end, we opted for the solution of selecting from a list. Many times, we aren't designing a perfect solution but rather balancing various factors to find equilibrium. Therefore, <strong>continually adjusting the weight of these factors in exploration helps us discover that clever balance.</strong></p>\n            <img :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/6/3-pairing-methods.png')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"\">\n\n            <h3 v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">3. 体能测验和记录</h3>\n            <h3 v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">3.

However, we were surprised by user interviews that the user's \"willingness to train\" may not necessarily align with their \"physical capabilities.\" For various reasons, users might want to train areas other than their weaker ones, or their weaker areas might not be suitable for training. Therefore, we allow users to adjust the priority order of training areas to customize their workout plans. <strong>What users need based on rational judgment may not be what they want.</strong> This is a contradiction between rationality and sensibility. I often ponder over this contradiction but have not reached a conclusion yet.

As a startup that needs to invest a lot of money into R&D, we don't have the extra money to shoot a lot of live action videos in a uniform style. And in the early days of R&D, we didn't know what kind of training actions the AI could support.

I gained insights into the challenges of fundraising and felt the urgency of racing against time. It ignited unlimited motivation and potential in me, pushing me to solve problems rather than complain about the current situation. I realized that design goes beyond visuals; I needed to step into production, and even <strong>participate in trade shows to promote our products.</strong> It wasn't the glamorous entrepreneurial life I had envisioned</p>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">在RaceFit，我们没有产品经理这个角色，而每个人都是产品经理，我们在会议上讨论一切关于产品的未来的计划，作为设计负责人，我还担任起整理这些需求和梳理优先级的工作。从那时起，我才真正意识到，<strong>一个好的产品并非构思一个天才的灵感，</strong>这种戏剧性的故事从来只会发生在电影里，真正的挑战是我们如何将一个个的点子付诸行动，落到实处，并不断收集反馈和迭代</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">At RaceFit, we don't have the role of a product manager; instead, everyone serves as a product manager. We discuss everything about the future plans for the product in our meetings. As the design lead, I also take on the responsibility of organizing these requirements and prioritizing them. It was from that point onward that I truly realized <strong>a great product isn't just about conceiving a brilliant idea</strong> – those dramatic stories typically only happen in movies. The real challenge lies in how we turn individual ideas into actions, bring them to fruition, and continuously gather feedback for iteration</p>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">最后，我学到了一个深刻的教训，<strong>如果一个产品不能切切实实地解决用户的需求，美观、性能、价格等等因素都会被远远地排除在外。</strong>我们获得了很多设计上的成功，我们获得了红点产品奖，入选了Microsoft的初创加速计划，似乎市场对产品的反响不错。但当你问我如果一个用户购买了我们的产品，独自一人开始使用，他真实的流程是什么，他的感受是什么？我很遗憾地说我真的不知道，在我们的设计中缺少了这一个环节，<strong>我们没有聆听用户真正的声音，</strong>而被他们在接受访谈时的客套话蒙骗了</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In the end, I learned a profound lesson: <strong>if a product doesn't genuinely address the user's needs, factors like aesthetics, performance, and price are all significantly sidelined.</strong> We achieved a lot of design success, received the Red Dot Product Design Award, and were selected for Microsoft's startup accelerator program. It seemed like there was positive market feedback for the product. However, when asked about the real experience of a user purchasing our product, using it alone, and their feelings during the process, I regret to say that I genuinely don't know.

I haven't created components for Page because, through Organism, all content and design drafts have already been archived, eliminating the need for repackaging. On the other hand, if Page were packaged as a component, every time Organism is updated, it would require a re-release of Page, making the release process for each component library update lengthy and redundant. On another note, when designers are exploring and need to detach certain components, the scope of detachment is controlled. Organisms that haven't been detached still retain the ability to be updated</p>\n            <img :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/7/page.png')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"\">\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">总的来说，设计师除了直接拷贝Page中的页面，还可以从场景出发，选择合适的Template,然后根据不同的插槽找到对应的Organism，并调整Organism中的引用的Molecule和Atom，从而达到引用此前设计页面的目的。而当组件更新时，这些更新会逐级传递到Organism，因此所有引用了这些Organism的地方都会得到更新</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In summary, besides directly copying pages from Page, designers can start from specific scenarios, choose the appropriate Template, and then, based on different slots, find the corresponding Organism. They can adjust the references to Molecules and Atoms within the Organism to achieve the goal of referencing previously designed pages. When components are updated, these updates will cascade down to Organism, ensuring that all instances referencing these Organisms receive the updates.</p>\n            <img :src=\"require('@/assets/projects/7/structure.png')\" alt=\"\" class=\"fade-up-enter\" style=\"\">\n\n\n        </PageSection>\n        <PageSection>\n            <h2 v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">除了提高了一致性，设计效率也得到有效提高</h2>\n            <h2 v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">In addition to improving consistency, design efficiency has also been effectively increased</h2>\n\n            <p v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">组件库上线后，获得了团队设计师的一致认同，在此后的项目设计中得到了广泛的应用</p>\n            <p v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">After the component library was launched, it gained unanimous approval from the team designers and was widely used in subsequent project designs.</p>\n            <div class=\"h-stack\" style=\"flex-wrap: wrap;\">\n\n                <Quote :SaidBy=\"'Sikang Li'\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0;\" v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">\n                    \"你的那个组件库真的太好用了！\"\n                </Quote>\n                <Quote :SaidBy=\"'Sikang Li'\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0;\" v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">\n                    \"The Component library you built is awesome!\"\n                </Quote>\n                \n                <Quote :SaidBy=\"'Sandra Yu'\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0;\" v-if=\"language=='ZH'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">\n                    \"哎子东，你有空给我介绍一下你的组件库呗，回头我给 Approve（Teams里的另一个官方应用） 也按照你的结构整一个\"\n                </Quote>\n                <Quote :SaidBy=\"'Sandra Yu'\" style=\"flex: 1 1 0;\" v-else-if=\"language=='EN'\" class=\"fade-up-enter\">\n                    \"Hey, could you introduce me to your component library?
